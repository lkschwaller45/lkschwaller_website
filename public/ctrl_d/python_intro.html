								<h2>Rough Start</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									<h5 style="text-align: center;">It is only the first time that counts</h5>
									<h5 style="text-align: center;"> 					- a french nobleman</h5>
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									A fact of life, is that the first step is always the hardest. Getting out of bed sucks,
									moving to a new area is terrifying, and getting that first job out of college can sometimes
									come only after a hundred panic attacks. This same sucky introduction applies to learning new skills
									and starting new hobbies. Adding to this innate rough start, when the skill is something
									spoken of socially as a complex weedy mess like programming is spoke of, it is no wonder that
									people are terrified to start actually programming. I can't claim the role of Mr. Miagi,
									there's simply no teacher in the world who can make you learn to program without your input.
									What I can offer here, is some good first steps that rely only on knowledge you would have learned in
									any school.
								</p>
								<h2>Before you can walk, you gotta put on shoes</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									You're not gonna learn to play football without gear, and you can't play guitar without the guitar.
									So how are we gonna start programming without an IDE? IDE stands for integrated development
									environment, but the short story of it is that it's a fancy notepad where we'll get
									hints and tools to allow us a much easier time learning the basic syntax of python.
									IDEs come in many flavors and colors, but I'm of the belief that Pycharm is the best beginner
									IDE for python, and it has really great documentation that can be found here:
									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
									<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows ">
								 		Click me to download pycharm community edition
									</a>
									</h5>
									Once you download the community edition of pycharm, you'll want to grab the actual
									python download as well. Think of it as letter and mailbox kind of system, the letter is
									your pycharm IDE, where you can write whatever you want to communicate, and the mailbox is your
									python download which takes in the letter and directs it where it needs to go in order
									to complete the communication. You can download python here, make sure when you install it
									you check the box to add python to PATH. This is extremely helpful for some advanced programming concepts.
									<h5 style="text-align: center;">
									<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">
								 		Click me to download python
									</a>
									</h5>
									As long as you install python before you open pycharm for the first time, it should walk you through selecting
									the python version you downloaded as your interpreter (once again think of the mailbox analogy, the mailbox understands
									the content on the letter to direct it where to go). If not, you can use pycharm's documentation on selecting an interpreter
									for your "project". A project is a local folder where you store your code and any dependencies of that code. In here we'll write
									all of our python scripts
								</p>
								<h2> Writing the first script</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									Once you've gotten this far pycharm should have given you an initial python file called main.
									Go ahead and delete the contents of this file, as we'll rewrite everything we need! Today we want
									a really simple program, one that might not be really useful in our daily lives, but will cover most basics of python.
									As such, we're going to rely on good ol' high school algebra and create a program that when given an array of x values
									will output an array of y values based on an equation we define.
								</p>
								<h3>Mathematics</h3>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									Let's back up for a brief second and explain the math we want to achieve here. An equation is an expression
									that tells us how two (or more) things relate. You'll probably know the classic equation
									<h5 style="text-align: center;"> Y = M * X + B</h5>
									This equation is the equation of any line, and is controlled by the x you input to get a y value.
									In this equation, M is the slope (or how quickly your line rises) and B is the y intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis of
									a graph. Typically when looking at an equation you think of entering one x value to get one y value, but in our case
									we want to feed this equation an array (or commonly called a list) of x values, and have it give us an array of y values.
									By doing this, we can get enough points that if we wanted to, we could graph the line itself! The final thing to understand, is that sometimes
									these equations are called functions if you look at them in broader terms.
								</p>
								<h3>Coding the Equation</h3>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									My goal here is to keep this extremely simple so that this could be your first program, so let's write this equation
									as just a simple function in a program. The correct name for a function in a program is a "Method". Methods allow us
									to feed input into them, and return outputs. We can define a method by using the key word def (as in definition). Let's
									refer to this first method as "Line_Calculator"
								<pre class="line-numbers">

									<code class="language-python">def Line_Calculator(x_values):</code>
								</pre>
									In this method defintion, we've used the keyword def, alongside a title that we chose.
									Additionally, by using (x_values) we've instructed our method to expect that we will be
									giving it an input of a variable known as a x_values. Now we know that we expect our
									x_values variable to be an array of numbers that we wish to input, but at this time our program actually
									has no idea what x_values is, to it is only a name.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">
									Now let's keep this first draft really simple, and say we only care about one slope, and
									one y-intercept. As such, let's plot a rather boring line, with a slope of 1, and an intercept at 0.
									Now if we think of the math behind this line, we can already know that this means we will get out
									 a y value of exactly what we put in for our x value, as 1 times any number is 1. Let's write this out though!
								<pre class="line-numbers">
									<code style="text-align: left;">
										def Line_Calculator(x_values):
											y_values = 1 * x_values
											return y_values
									</code>
								</pre>
